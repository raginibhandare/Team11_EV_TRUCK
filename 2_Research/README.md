The first Volvo FE Electric, a refuse truck with a superstructure developed together with Europe's 
leading refuse collection bodybuilder, Faun, will start operating in early 2019 in Germany’s second largest city, Hamburg. The Volvo FE Electric trucks join NFI’s fleet of more than 4,500 heavy-duty tractors that support its dedicated transportation and port drayage services for customers spanning from manufacturing to retail. The pilot trucks will be based out of one of NFI’s warehouse facilities in Southern California that serves as a central distribution center for the region. “As the future of goods movement in the U.S. changes from more of a long-haul operation to regional and hub and spoke models, not only is that NFI's wheelhouse, it’s an ideal scenario to immerse electrification into our regional hauling strategy,” said Jim O’Leary, vice president, Assets/Fleet Services, NFI Industries. “Our executive team is excited to collaborate with the Volvo LIGHTS team to accelerate our transition to a zero-emission fleet, so that we can lower our carbon footprint, reduce our operating costs and provide a better work environment for our drivers.”

Volvo has introduced the FE Electric, a full electrically-powered truck that’s designed to take on city operations. It is the second electric truck from the Swedish automaker--the first is called FL Electric. This only shows Volvo’s commitment to expand its electrically-powered product lineup.he new Volvo FE Electric is bigger - designed for heavier city distribution and refuse transport operations - with gross weights of up to 27 tonnes (vs. 16 tonnes in case of FL Electric) and is equipped with two electric motors instead of one (total 370 kW).
The battery options will be 200-300 kWh for up to 200 km (125 miles) of range (FL was from 100 kWh).

## Introduction

Volvo designed the VNR to be comfortable for drivers—all drivers. Its steering wheel features a three-way neck tilt to position the wheel exactly where it’s most comfortable. The steering wheel houses buttons that toggle through operating parameters, trip information, performance data, and more in the 5-inch driver information cluster in the dash. The VNR also features a 7-inch infotainment screen where drivers can access Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, GPS, and connect to Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. Volvo also designed the VNR to provide better driver visibility.

The Volvo VNR Electric trucks will be integrated into NFI's commercial operations, demonstrating the ability for battery-electric trucks to successfully transport goods under a variety of operating conditions. The Volvo VNR Electric heavy-duty trucks provide excellent responsiveness, torque and performance, especially in the heavy-idling, stop-and-go nature of urban goods movement which is particularly taxing for diesel trucks.

The VNR Electric merges the VNR series’ agility, versatility, safety, and visibility with the VNR Electric’s sustainability. The VNR Electric drivetrain is rated at 455 hp with up to 4,051 lb-ft of torque. It also features Volvo’s two-speed I-Shift automated transmission, and it can achieve speeds up to 65 mph on the highway.

Volvo doused its VNR Electric in safety features, complete with additional protection in the VNR Electric’s battery cage. Included in all VNR Electrics is Volvo Active Driving Assist, a forward collision avoidance technology helping drivers respond and avoid threatening traffic situations. This technology uses cameras and radars to keep the driver alert of traffic changes at all times. Lane Departure Warnings are also included. As for the additional battery protection, Volvo’s VNR Electric battery box features a side impact protection barrier.
# BENEFITS OF ELECTRIC TRUCKS
 *  Lower emissions
 
 *  Lower maintenance
  
 *  Lower noise disturbance
 
 *  Better performance
 
 *  Increased efficiency

It is always cheaper to charge your electric truck than spending money on gas. Electric trucks provide businesses with many benefits that primarily aim for the long run.
EV trucks do not require fuel, which is already one of the biggest advantages, due to fuel cost and effect on nature.
Driving electric trucks reduces CO2 emissions and actually offers better performance for drivers.EV trucks also have less parts, which should lead to less damage and lower maintenance. 
However, this depends on a truck model and its usage.While driving within urban areas with frequent stops and speeding, it is way more efficient to drive electric truck than diesel truck.
# The specification is given below:
##	Battery :
### Lithium-ion Polymer
-	Battery type used in this EV is Lithium-ion Polymer. 
-	Lithium is also the lightest of all metals. However, lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries contain no lithium metal, they contain ions. For those wondering what an ion is, an ion is a an atom or molecule with an electric charge caused by the loss or gain of one or more electrons.
-	Battery Features:
-	Lithium-ion batteries are one of the most popular forms of energy storage in the world, accounting for 85.6% of deployed energy storage systems

###  Nickel Metal Hydride Battery
- The Nickel Metal Hydride Battery has potential for yet higher energy densities. 
- Less prone to memory than the Ni-Cd.
-  Periodic exercise cycles are required less often. 
-  Simple storage and transportation
## Controller:
### PID Controller:
- Proportional action is the “universal” control action, capable of providing at least marginal control quality for any process.
- Integral action is useful for eliminating offset caused by load variations and process self regulation.
- Derivative action is useful for canceling lags, but useless by itself.
- Limitations of each action
- Proportional action will cause oscillations if sufficiently aggressive, in the presence of lags and/or dead time.
-  transportation conditions are not subject to regulatory control.
-  Gain and phase shift of each action
-  Proportional action acts on the present, adding no phase shift to a sinusoidal signal. Its gain is constant for any signal frequency.
##  Inverter:
### Traction inverter
- Traction inverters convert dc power from an on-board high voltage (HV) battery into ac power to drive the main motor or motors of an electric vehicle.
-  In addition, traction inverters perform functions such as voltage boosting, switch protection and regenerative braking.
-   This key component has a direct impact on road performance, driving range and reliability of the vehicle also as a consequence of their weight and size

## Motor:
### Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM)
- Low torque ripple 
This motor has low torque ripple so it can generate constant torque. Also its ability to maintain full torque at low speeds.
- High efficiency 
Permanent magnet motor full-load efficiency is higher than an AC induction motor. It’s a rotor magnet made by using a permanent magnet so this motor has high efficiency. Because its rotor hasn’t any coil so heat generation is less.
- Small size 
It may offer a smaller size for more compact mechanical packages. So permanent magnet motor highly useful for industrial tasks.
- DC power source 
Don’t need an extra DC power source for it. The AC supply is provided on the stator and the permanent magnets are on the rotor.

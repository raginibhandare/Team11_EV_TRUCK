## Introduction

Volvo designed the VNR to be comfortable for drivers—all drivers. Its steering wheel features a three-way neck tilt to position the wheel exactly where it’s most comfortable. The steering wheel houses buttons that toggle through operating parameters, trip information, performance data, and more in the 5-inch driver information cluster in the dash. The VNR also features a 7-inch infotainment screen where drivers can access Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, GPS, and connect to Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. Volvo also designed the VNR to provide better driver visibility.

The Volvo VNR Electric trucks will be integrated into NFI's commercial operations, demonstrating the ability for battery-electric trucks to successfully transport goods under a variety of operating conditions. The Volvo VNR Electric heavy-duty trucks provide excellent responsiveness, torque and performance, especially in the heavy-idling, stop-and-go nature of urban goods movement which is particularly taxing for diesel trucks.

The VNR Electric merges the VNR series’ agility, versatility, safety, and visibility with the VNR Electric’s sustainability. The VNR Electric drivetrain is rated at 455 hp with up to 4,051 lb-ft of torque. It also features Volvo’s two-speed I-Shift automated transmission, and it can achieve speeds up to 65 mph on the highway.

Volvo doused its VNR Electric in safety features, complete with additional protection in the VNR Electric’s battery cage. Included in all VNR Electrics is Volvo Active Driving Assist, a forward collision avoidance technology helping drivers respond and avoid threatening traffic situations. This technology uses cameras and radars to keep the driver alert of traffic changes at all times. Lane Departure Warnings are also included. As for the additional battery protection, Volvo’s VNR Electric battery box features a side impact protection barrier.

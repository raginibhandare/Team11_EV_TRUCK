## Introduction
The new Volvo FE Electric will be offered in several variants for different types of transport 
assignment. For instance with Volvo’s low-entry cab, which makes it easier to enter and exit the cab 
and gives the driver a commanding view of surrounding traffic. The working environment improves 
too as a result of the low noise level and vibration-free operation. Battery capacity can be optimised 
to suit individual needs, and charging takes place either via the mains or via quick-charge stations.
The Volvo FE is easy to handle even in 
the most congested spaces. It is a vehicle that allows for easy manoeuvring and 
smooth acceleration, as well as providing 
an array of instruments to help you navigate every situation.The Volvo FE can be specified to meet 
your superstructure demands. The FE 6×2 rigid with its low noise level, excellent all-round visibility and 
easy manoeuvring makes it the perfect choice for refuse transporting operations. Frequent stops and starts 
are aided by the D8K engine with power ratings up to 350 hp, combined with automatic transmission or 
I-Shift. When super low emissions are required, there’s a CNG powered driveline option available. The low 
instep offers a convenient entry with anti-slip steps, and the cabs offer among the best close up and all round visibility there is in the industry.

The Volvo FE engine range ensures 
performance for city and regional distribution as well as construction duties – while at the same time 
offering alternatives for sensitive environments with stringent emissions regulations. An extended 
output range stretching from 250 to 350 hp including synthetic diesel, biodiesel and gas alternatives enables you to tailor the driveline for your needs. This is part of our long-term ambition to move 
towards zero emissions

# BENEFITS OF ELECTRIC TRUCKS

It is always cheaper to charge your electric truck than spending money on gas. Electric trucks provide businesses with many benefits that primarily aim for the long run.
EV trucks do not require fuel, which is already one of the biggest advantages, due to fuel cost and effect on nature.
Driving electric trucks reduces CO2 emissions and actually offers better performance for drivers.EV trucks also have less parts, which should lead to less damage and lower maintenance. 
However, this depends on a truck model and its usage.While driving within urban areas with frequent stops and speeding, it is way more efficient to drive electric truck than diesel truck.
# The specification is given below:

### Battery :
Power and torque.
The G9K engine delivers a full 320 hp 
and 1356 Nm of torque, and has been 
primarily developed for operations 
involving short driving cycles with frequent starts and stop.
### Automatic transmission:
The 6-speed automatic transmission 
makes the Volvo FE CNG an easy to use 
productive tool for urban transports.
### Operating range:
Choose between 2×4 or 2×3 gas tanks 
fitted on the chassis. This gives an 
operating range of up to 400 km in light 
distribution and up to 250 km in severe 
refuse collection.

### Lithium-ion Polymer
-	Battery type used in this EV is Lithium-ion Polymer. 
-	Lithium is also the lightest of all metals. However, lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries contain no lithium metal, they contain ions. For those wondering what an ion is, an ion is a an atom or molecule with an electric charge caused by the loss or gain of one or more electrons.
-	Battery Features:
-	Lithium-ion batteries are one of the most popular forms of energy storage in the world, accounting for 85.6% of deployed energy storage systems

###  Nickel Metal Hydride Battery
- The Nickel Metal Hydride Battery has potential for yet higher energy densities. 
- Less prone to memory than the Ni-Cd.
-  Periodic exercise cycles are required less often. 
-  Simple storage and transportation
## Controller:
### PID Controller:
- Proportional action is the “universal” control action, capable of providing at least marginal control quality for any process.
- Integral action is useful for eliminating offset caused by load variations and process self regulation.
- Derivative action is useful for canceling lags, but useless by itself.
- Limitations of each action
- Proportional action will cause oscillations if sufficiently aggressive, in the presence of lags and/or dead time.
-  transportation conditions are not subject to regulatory control.
-  Gain and phase shift of each action
-  Proportional action acts on the present, adding no phase shift to a sinusoidal signal. Its gain is constant for any signal frequency.

## Motor:
### Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM)
